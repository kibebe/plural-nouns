This python script construct plural nouns in English:

It follows the following rules in constructing the plurals:

• If a word ends in S, X, or Z, add ES. Bass becomes basses, fax becomes faxes, and waltz becomes waltzes.

• If a word ends in a noisy H, add ES; if it ends in a silent H, just add S. What’s a noisy H? One that gets 
  combined with other letters to make a sound that you can hear. So coach becomes coaches and rash becomes rashes,
  because you can hear the CH and SH sounds when you say them. But cheetah becomes cheetahs, because the H is silent.

• If a word ends in Y that sounds like I, change the Y to IES; if the Y is combined with a vowel to sound like
  something else, just add S. So vacancy becomes vacancies, but day becomes days.

• If all else fails, just add S and hope for the best.

There are alot of exceptions. Man becomes men and woman becomes women, but human becomes humans.
 
Mouse becomes mice and louse becomes lice, but house becomes houses.
